# Volume-Control

Controling the volume virtually just by using your two finger tips, with the help of the MediaPipe modules. The program will track the landmarks of your thumb and your index finger. I used the PyCaw which uses the core windows audio libraries and connects the audio with the program.   

## MediaPipe
MediaPipe is a framework for building multimodal (eg. video, audio, any time series data), cross platform (i.e Android, iOS, web, edge devices) applied ML pipelines. With MediaPipe, a perception pipeline can be built as a graph of modular components, including, for instance, inference models (e.g., TensorFlow, TFLite) and media processing functions.
